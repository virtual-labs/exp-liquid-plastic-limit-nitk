      "question": " The liquid limit can be defined as the arbitrary limit of water content at which the soil is just about to pass from the _____ state into the _______ state.",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Liquid to solid",
        "b": "Plastic to solid",
        "c": "Liquid to plastic",
        "d": "Plastic state to liquid"
      },
      "explanations": {
		"a": "According to the definition of atterberg's limit, the liquid limit is defined as the limit of water content at which the soil changes from plastic state to liquid state and not liquid to solid state.",
        "b": "According to the definition of atterberg's limit, the liquid limit is defined as the limit of water content at which the soil changes from plastic state to liquid state and not plastic to solid state.",
        "c": "According to the definition of atterberg's limit, the liquid limit is defined as the limit of water content at which the soil changes from plastic state to liquid state and not liquid to plastic state.",
        "d": "Correct answer. According to the definition of atterberg's limit, the liquid limit is defined as the limit of water content at which the soil changes from plastic state to liquid state."

      "question": "The plastic limit is the water content where soil starts to exhibit _________ behaviour.",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Liquid",
        "b": "Semi solid",
        "c": "Plastic",
        "d": "solid"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "According to the atterberg's limit and the corresponding graph, the plastic limit zone starts when the soil starts to exhibit plastic behaviour and not liquid behaviour.",
        "b": "According to the Atterberg’s limit and the corresponding graph, semi solid behaviour is exhibited when there is a lot of resistance to flow of the soil and in this range the soil turns from solid state to semi solid state.",
        "c": "Correct answer. According to the Atterberg’s limit and the corresponding graph the plastic zone is marked when soil starts to show plastic behaviour and ends when the soil starts to show liquid behaviour.",
        "d": "According to Atterberg’s limit and the corresponding graph, a soil to be classified as solid, the amount of water content present in the soil is very low due to which the soil shows solid state properties."

        "a": "IS:2720 part 5 1975 does not exist, the correct year of publication is 1985.",
        "b": "Correct answer. IS:2720 part 5 1985 consists of the procedures for conducting the liquid limit and plastic limit tests.",
        "c": "IS:2720 part 6 1975 does not exist, the correct year of publication is 1985.",

        "a": "Ip= LL – PL",
        "b": "Ip= PL – LL",
        "c": "Ip= PL + LL",
        "d": "Ip= LL + PL"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct answer. The Plasticity Index is defined as the range of moisture contents over which the soil deforms plastically, hence this phenomena ranges between the liquid and plastic limit.",
        "b": "The Plasticity Index is defined as the range of moisture contents over which the soil deforms plastically, hence this phenomena ranges between the liquid and plastic limit, as plastic limit is a lower value than liquid limit, we will be obtaining a negative value which is not true.",
        "c": "The Plasticity Index is defined as the range of moisture contents over which the soil deforms plastically, hence this phenomena ranges between the liquid and plastic limit and not the addition of liquid limit and plastic limit.",
        "d": The Plasticity Index is defined as the range of moisture contents over which the soil deforms plastically, hence this phenomena ranges between the liquid and plastic limit and not the addition of liquid limit and plastic limit.

      "question": "If the value of the liquid limit is less than 35%, then the compressibility is _____.",

        "b": "intermediate",
        "c": "Low",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "If the liquid limit of soil is greater than 50%, then the soil can be classified as high compressibility.",
        "b": "If the liquid limit of soil is less than 35%, then the soil can be classified as Low compressibility.It is not considered as intermediate. The value ranges between 35-50%.",
        "c": "Correct answer. If the liquid limit of soil is less than 35%, then the soil can be classified as Low compressibility.",
        "d": "The correct answer is if the liquid limit is less than 35% then the compressibility is low. As one of the options given above is correct, option “none of the above” is incorrect."
